It Happened
===========

It Happened is an event catalog. You creat events and record every time they
happen.

This is a toy app that I'm developing to learn the [Elm programming language][1],
material design and how to develop a web app that works equally well on desktop
and mobile.

For material design I am using the excelent [MaterializeCSS][2] css + js library.
